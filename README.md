# CapstoneProject_MySoldiers_DanWay
This application was created in fullfilment of the requirements for C#.NET Ful-Stack Software Developer 12 week Bootcamp at Claim Academy.
The intended use of My Soldiers App is to create a Single Point of Entry (SPOE) to manage Soldier information pertaining to the Soldiers that are under their
Leadership. This can range from team leader to Battalion Commander and beyond. The sole purpose is to reduce the number of systems to
log into and have the information readily available to produce manning reports, training reports, personal qualification requirements,
weapons qualifications, equipment inventory, vehicle licensing program and a variety of other information that leaders of today's Army
can utilize in managing their Soldiers information.
